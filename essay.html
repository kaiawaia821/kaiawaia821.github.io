    As militaries embrace autonomous weapons, AI-driven warfare threatens to erase accountability, deepen human suffering, and prolong global conflict.

  <!-- Introduction Section -->
  <section class="introduction">


    <p>When <em>The Terminator</em> first premiered, its vision of a future ruled by ruthless AI war machines felt like distant science fiction. Today, the rapid rise of autonomous weapons brings that dark scenario closer to reality, threatening to prolong conflicts and increase the toll on both combatants and civilians.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Lavender System Section -->
  <section class="lavender-system">
    <h2>The Lavender System</h2>
    <p>Militaries of today are turning toward AI, despite the infancy of the technology.  An AI system referred to as “Lavender” is employed in the relentless bombing of Palestine today. Lavender is an AI system developed by Israeli military intelligence to identify suspected militants in Gaza. It analyzes mass surveillance data, such as cellphone patterns or social media activity, and assigns individuals a rating 1–100 reflecting their likelihood of being affiliated with. Those above a certain threshold are marked as targets for assassination (Yuval). </p>
    <div class="video-container">
      <iframe
              width="100%"
              height="400"
              src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rR_UAyr6viM"

      </iframe>
    </div>
    <p>Israeli personnel spent 20 seconds confirming targets were male, then approve the strike. No further verification or research was put into the target.  A complimentary AI system named “Where’s Daddy?”  then tracked targets deemed by Lavender as militants to their house, then conducted strikes at the dead of night, regardless of who was home at the time. </p>
    <p>With these two AI systems, use of “dumb bombs”—bombs that sacrifice precision for low cost and increased destruction, a 10% error rate from Lavender, and policy that allows 15-20 civilian casualties per junior militants and 100+ for higher ranking members, Israel creates a perfect recipe for complete carnage of the Palestinian people—militants and civilians combined.</p>

  <!-- Shell Shock -->
  <section class="shell_shock">
    <h2>Shell Shock: The Collapse of Combat Morale</h2>
    <p>Beyond escalating civilian casualties, AI’s ability to anonymize killing risks stripping warfare of its moral gravity, fostering a dangerous detachment that allows conflicts to persist unchecked. Wars have one of two outcomes—swiftly defeat your opponent or drag on until morale among your soldiers drops low enough. World War I played out like the latter. Between the constant bombing, poor conditions in the trenches, and the visceral act of killing another human at close range, this war gave birth to a new term— “shell shock.” </p>
    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.military-history.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Shell-shocked-Tommy-1916-1.jpg?fit=702%2C467&ssl=1" alt="Shell Shock" class="responsive-image">
    <p>Shell shock, now commonly referred to as PTSD, is the peak of low morale for a soldier. A soldier’s low morale is the most effective extinguisher to a war-- if you don’t have soldiers to fight your war then there is no war to be fought (Serban). This is where AI is integrated–if the cause of PTSD is the act of personally killing another person at close range, then the answer is simple: remove the personal aspect, using AI and drones.</p>
    <p>Without the depleted morale of their soldiers, modern militaries are free to carry out their reign of terror on whatever third world country for as long as they want. They even play into this fact, catering their advertisements towards gamers; a mostly young, male audience whose only understanding comes from Call of Duty or similar titles.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- COD-ification Section -->
  <section class="cod-ification">
    <h2>The "COD-ification" of War</h2>
    <p>This is a phenomenon I call the “COD-ification” of war. Much like the detached, pixelated violence of video games such as Call of Duty, modern AI-driven warfare reduces the act of killing to a series of abstract, impersonal decisions. </p>
    <p> In Call of Duty, players pull the trigger without witnessing the human cost of their actions—no blood, no screams, no grieving families. The game glorifies war, framing it as a thrilling, high-stakes competition where players earn rewards for kills and victories, all while remaining insulated from the real-world consequences of violence.</p>
    <div class="video-container">
      <iframe
              width="100%"
              height="400"
              src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DwZ8GxqwKq4"
              title="YouTube video player"
              frameborder="0"
              allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
              allowfullscreen>
      </iframe>
    </div>
    <p>This sanitized portrayal doesn’t just entertain; it shapes perceptions, leading many to believe that war is a clean, heroic endeavor rather than the chaotic, devastating reality it truly is (Kaur). Similarly, systems like Lavender and Where’s Daddy? transform real-world violence into a sterile, data-driven process. </p>
    <p>Soldiers no longer see the faces of their targets or the devastation their bombs leave behind; instead, they interact with spreadsheets, algorithms, and surveillance feeds. Just as Call of Duty turns war into entertainment, AI-driven warfare turns killing into a bureaucratic task—one that is stripped of its moral weight and human cost.</p>

  <!-- Conclusion Section -->
  <section class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The use of AI in war has stripped people of their humanity, creating a generational issue. Wars are lasting longer, more people are dying, and less people are caring. If AI technology is not banned as a military tool, the situation will only worsen as technology to spread harm without the human aspect advances. In order to solve the problem that has been created by AI technology, it needs to be removed from all aspects of the military.</p>
  <p>This cannot be a solution that is only applied in the US. It needs to be codified into international law. If this solution can not be agreed upon we will spiral and approach situations similar to the Cold War as the technology advances, just the same as when the technology behind nuclear warfare spiraled out of control. </p>
